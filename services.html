          Not all process servers are created equal. Some companies make
          exaggerated claims and quote low-ball fees just to get your business.

          norms. Our goal is not just service but UNCHALLENGEABLE SERVICE. If
          your Defendant or Witness must be located, and personally served, WE

          Time Stamped. Whenever possible signature of the Witness or Defendant
          is requested to memorialize the serve. All service quotes cover
          initial Service Attempts, 10 Pages of Printing, Return or Proof of
          Service, as well as Notarized Affidavit of Service. Additional
          services that may become necessary will be requested by our staff via
          phone followed up with an email for authorization. We are
          court-approved by the General Sessions Court of Knox County,
          Tennessee. We are vetted, insured and bonded to provide our clients
          unparalleled execution of Service no matter the jurisdiction in

        closure rate of 98.2%. We pride ourselves on our ability to skip trace
        those who would seemingly disappear to elude collection or process
